<h1>Eiichiro Oda</h1>

<p>Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series One Piece (1997–present)
With more than 516.6 million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors.[2]
The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.[3]
Early life of Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. He said that at the age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job".
[4] His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball.[4][5] He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking.
[6] He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman. Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.
