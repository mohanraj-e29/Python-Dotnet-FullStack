The series is the 73rd Ashes series and the 37th to take place in England. This series also marks the first time in the Ashes' 139-year history that no Test will take place in August in an Ashes series hosted by England. 
The series was brought forward to June and July so as not to clash with The Hundred tournament, which is due to start in August.[6] 
For the first time in Ashes history, Australia will play no tour matches against county teams, although they did play the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final against India in London a week before the Ashes series.[7][8]
