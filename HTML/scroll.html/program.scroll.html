The series was brought forward to June and July so as not to clash with The Hundred tournament, which is due to start in August.[6] 
For the first time in Ashes history, Australia will play no tour matches against county teams, although they did play the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final against India in London a week before the Ashes series.[7][8]
